## Lessons Learned Report
1. **Reynold Monestine**
 - Through the project design process, I gained valuable insights into project management, growing to understand the importance of effective communication and teamwork. While successfully completing tasks, I realized the significance of dedicating more time to brainstorming sessions for innovative ideas. In the future, I aim to prioritize early collaboration and establish structured meeting schedules to enhance project outcomes and management positions.

2. **Keisha Moreau**
 -  During this project, I learned invaluable lessons about project management. I gained hands-on experience in gathering requirements effectively and creating comprehensive project plans using tools like Gantt charts and work breakdown structures. Additionally, I discovered the importance of collaboration and communication between team members in ensuring project success.

3. **Kameron Norwood**
-   What I learned from this project is that it takes commitment. Throughout the process, every step towards completion has to be done right. If a section falls apart, then the entire project is affected. What I would do differently in the future is communicate a little bit more with my group members.
