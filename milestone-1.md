## SWOT Analysis


### Strengths:
1. Social Impact Focus: TechConnect's primary strength lies in its commitment to addressing the digital divide in underserved communities, contributing to social development and empowerment.

   
2. Holistic Approach: The proposed app combines mentorship, resource connection, and educational content, offering a comprehensive solution to bridge the digital gap. This multifaceted approach enhances its effectiveness.

3. Technology Integration: Leveraging technology for social good showcases a technological prowess that aligns with the mission. The app's tech-related courses demonstrate a commitment to building digital literacy from the ground up.

### Weaknesses:
1. Resource Dependency: The success of the app heavily relies on the availability of mentors, local resources, and online educational content. A shortage of these resources might limit the app's impact.

2. Digital Literacy Barriers: In communities with limited digital exposure, there may be challenges in getting the target audience to adapt to and effectively utilize the app. Overcoming this learning curve is crucial for success.
   
### Opportunities:
1. Rising Demand for Tech Education: The increasing importance of tech skills provides an opportunity for TechConnect to tap into a growing demand for programming and computer fundamentals courses, aligning with global trends.

2. Collaborative Partnerships: Establishing partnerships with local community organizations, tech companies, and educational institutions can enhance the app's reach, effectiveness, and resource availability.

### Threats:
1. Competing Platforms: Similar initiatives or commercial platforms offering mentorship and educational content could pose competition. TechConnect must differentiate itself through its unique value proposition and community-centric approach.

2. Limited Connectivity: In areas with poor internet connectivity or limited access to smartphones, the effectiveness of an app-based solution might be hindered. The team should strategize to address these infrastructural challenges.

3. Sustainability Challenges: Ensuring long-term sustainability may be a threat, especially if funding or support wanes over time. Developing a robust sustainability plan is crucial for the app's continuity.

## Team Contract
[MMW&N Team Contract](https://github.com/cis-famu/design-project-mmw-n/blob/main/MMW%26N%20Team%20Contract.pdf)

### Goals: 

Our goal is to create an efficient and achievable project plan to follow. Skills that we want to refine and develop are project and time management as well as effective communication and collaboration. We aim to enhance our team's overall productivity and ensure seamless coordination among team members.  
### Expectations: 

We expect transparent and honest communication among team members across every aspect of the project. Regular attendance and consistent participation in meetings and assigned tasks are also anticipated. The standard for work quality should consistently be high.

### Policies & Procedures:  
1.	Frequent meetings to discuss and clarify tasks.
2.	Communicate two hours in advance if you are not able to attend meetings
3.	Active and respectful participation during meetings to ensure effective collaboration

### Consequences:
The team commits to transparent communication if a team member falls short of meeting expectations, and a tally system will be implemented to monitor individual and collective contributions to the project. The system will serve as an objective measure, to identify areas of improvement. It will include meeting attendance and task completion. In the event of accumulating too many tallies, a team meeting will be held to openly discuss and address the challenges or issues contributing to the excessive tallies.
